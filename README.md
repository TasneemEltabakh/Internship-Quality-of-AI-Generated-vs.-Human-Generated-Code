# Folder 3: AI-Generated Code

This folder contains scripts and datasets related to AI-generated code, specifically solutions generated by GPT-4. The data is used for further analysis and processing in other parts of the project.

## Project Components

- **Cleaned_ProblemSolutionPythonV3.csv**: A CSV file containing cleaned AI-generated code solutions for various problems.
- **output_with_solutions_GPT4.csv**: A CSV file with raw GPT-4-generated code solutions, which may include uncleaned and preprocessed code snippets.
- **main.py**: The main Python script to process and manage AI-generated code, which can perform operations like cleaning or transforming the data for subsequent stages.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Data Processing

1. **Input**:
   - The `Cleaned_ProblemSolutionPythonV3.csv` file contains AI-generated solutions that have been cleaned.
   - The `output_with_solutions_GPT4.csv` contains the raw GPT-4 code output.

2. **Process**:
   - Before running the `main.py` script, ensure the following imports and OpenAI client initialization are included in the script:
   
   ```python
         $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"
     ```
## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the folder** `3. AI-Generated Code`.
2. Ensure that the input CSV files (`Cleaned_ProblemSolutionPythonV3.csv` and `output_with_solutions_GPT4.csv`) are correctly placed in the folder.
3. Add the required imports and initialize the OpenAI client in `main.py`.
4. Run the `main.py` script to process the AI-generated code for further use.

### Dependencies

Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the scripts:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas**
- **openai**

You can install external dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas openai
```


# Folder 4: Matrices Generation

This folder contains scripts to generate matrices for AI (GPT-4) solutions and human solutions. The process involves separating code snippets into individual Python files and then generating feature matrices from those files. 

## Folder Structure

- **4.1 Generate GPT-4 Solution's Matrix Files**: Contains scripts to process GPT-4 generated code solutions and generate corresponding feature matrices.
- **4.2 Generate Human Solution's Matrix Files**: Contains scripts to process human-generated code solutions and generate corresponding feature matrices.

## Project Components

### Common Scripts in Both Folders (4.1 & 4.2)

- **separated-files.py**: This script extracts individual code snippets from a dataset (CSV file) and saves them as separate Python files. It is used to process both AI-generated and human-generated solutions.
- **MatrixGenration.py**: This script generates feature matrices from the Python files created by `separated-files.py`. The matrices represent various code metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index, etc.
  
Each folder has its own dataset and output files:

### 4.1: Generate GPT-4 Solution's Matrix Files

- **Input Dataset**: Contains AI (GPT-4) generated code solutions.
- **separated-files.py**: Processes the GPT-4 code snippets from the dataset and creates separate Python files.
- **MatrixGenration.py**: Processes the separated Python files and generates a matrix with various metrics.

### 4.2: Generate Human Solution's Matrix Files

- **Input Dataset**: Contains human-generated code solutions.
- **separated-files.py**: Processes the human code snippets from the dataset and creates separate Python files.
- **MatrixGenration.py**: Processes the separated Python files and generates a matrix with various metrics.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Python Files from Code Snippets

1. **Input**:
   - **4.1** uses a CSV dataset containing GPT-4 code solutions.
   - **4.2** uses a CSV dataset containing human-generated code solutions.

2. **Process**:
   - The `separated-files.py` script reads the dataset, extracts the code snippets, and writes each snippet into an individual Python file.

3. **Execution**:
   ```bash
   python separated-files.py
   ```
### Step 2: Generate Feature Matrices

#### Input:

- The individual Python files generated from the previous step.

#### Process:

- The `MatrixGenration.py` script computes various code metrics for each Python file and constructs a feature matrix for further analysis.

#### Execution:

```bash
python MatrixGenration.py
```

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the respective folder** (`4.1 Generate GPT-4 Solution's Matrix Files` or `4.2 Generate Human Solution's Matrix Files`).
2. Run the `separated-files.py` script to generate individual Python files from the dataset.
3. Run the `MatrixGenration.py` script to generate the feature matrix.

### Dependencies

Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the scripts:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas**
- **os** (built-in library)
- **ast** (built-in library)

You can install external dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
```


# 5: Machine Learning Model

This folder contains the implementation of a machine learning model to classify code segments as either human-written or AI-generated. The model leverages various code metrics, and its performance is analyzed through several visualizations and metric evaluations.

## Project Components

This folder includes the following key components:

- **Model.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the full pipeline for training, evaluating, and analyzing the machine learning model. The notebook includes data loading, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.
- **main-dataset.xlsx**: The dataset used to train and test the machine learning model. This Excel file includes various code metrics.
- **Images and Visualizations**: A set of visualizations generated from the model's performance and data analysis.

## Model Overview

The goal of this model is to classify whether a given code snippet is AI-generated or human-written based on the following code metrics:

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**
- **Maintainability Index**
- **Source Lines of Code (SLOC)**

- **Number of Parameters**
- **Afferent and Efferent Coupling**

### Key Features
